Hi,
I'm a mechanical engineer with about 20 years of experience.
I want to acquire programming skills as well, and maybe, in the future, work as a programmer—who knows?
For now, I know JavaScript, and six years ago, I created my online store, which is still running today: www.tushe.od.ua.
For this store, I used vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML, a bit of PHP for the server side, and Firebird for the database, so I have a general idea of how things work.
Now, I'm learning assembler to understand the processes on a deeper level.
My next goal is to learn C++ because I can use it in my mechanical engineering tasks by programming controllers for my needs.
After that, I plan to start contributing to open-source projects in web development.

I would greatly appreciate any help from the community during my journey.
Thank you!
